function Disconnect-PIMServices {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Disconnects from Microsoft Graph and Azure services used by PIM operations.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
        Cleanly disconnects from all connected Microsoft Graph and Azure services,
        clears policy caches, and performs cleanup operations. This function should
        be called when finishing PIM-related tasks to ensure proper session cleanup.
    
    .EXAMPLE
        Disconnect-PIMServices
        
        Disconnects from all PIM-related services and clears caches.
    
    .EXAMPLE
        Disconnect-PIMServices -Verbose
        
        Disconnects from services with detailed verbose output showing each step.
    
    .NOTES
        - Clears the PIM policy cache before disconnecting
        - Safely handles disconnection even if services are not connected
        - Uses SilentlyContinue to prevent errors for already disconnected services
