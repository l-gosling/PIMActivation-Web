function Get-MembershipType {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Determines whether a role assignment is direct or through group membership.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
        Analyzes a role assignment object to determine if the role is assigned directly 
        to the principal or inherited through group membership. Supports Entra roles, 
        Group roles, and Azure Resource roles.
    
    .PARAMETER Assignment
        The role assignment object to analyze. This can be from various sources including
        active assignments, eligible assignments, or role eligibility schedule instances.
    
    .PARAMETER RoleType
        Specifies the type of role assignment to analyze.
        Valid values: 'Entra', 'Group', 'AzureResource'
    
    .EXAMPLE
        Get-MembershipType -Assignment $entraAssignment -RoleType 'Entra'
        Returns 'Direct' or 'Group' based on the assignment's membership type.
    
    .EXAMPLE
        Get-MembershipType -Assignment $groupAssignment -RoleType 'Group'
        Returns 'Direct' since group assignments are always direct.
    
    .OUTPUTS
        System.String
        Returns either 'Direct' or 'Group' indicating the membership type.
    
    .NOTES
        For Entra roles, the function checks multiple properties including MemberType,
        IsTransitive, AssignmentType, and may query eligible assignments to determine
        the true membership source.
