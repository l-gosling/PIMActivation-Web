---

## [1.2.6] - 2025-11-27

### Added
- **Support for custom App registration**: New parameters ClientId and TenantId on Start-PIMActivation and Connect-PIMServices. Providing both will cause Connect-MgGraph to use the specified custom app registration for delegated auth; otherwise it falls back to the original interactive flow.

### Notes
- App-only auth (client secret/cert) is not enabled; PIM operations pstill require delegated permissions.

---

## [1.2.5] - 2025-08-13

### Fixed
- **Graph Query Limitation**: Resolved policy retrieval issues for large role sets (e.g., >20 eligible roles of the same type) using chunked batching and a REST-based path with pagination for reliable results at scale.
- **Fallback Behavior**: Ensured robust per-item fallback when complex filters are rejected or return zero results.
- **Control Flow**: Corrected `Get-PIMPoliciesBatch` logic and applied `-ErrorAction Stop` so fallbacks trigger consistently.
- **Regression Removal**: Eliminated a transient 400 InvalidResource/InvalidFilter regression introduced during iteration.

### Technical Improvements
- **ArrayList Performance**: Replaced array concatenation with ArrayList/AddRange in hot paths (Get-PIMRoles and batch aggregations).
- **Enumeration Stability**: Flattened ArrayList before mapping policies to avoid incorrect enumeration.
- **Resilient Error Handling**: Treated InvalidResource the same as InvalidFilter for more resilient behavior across tenants.
- **Memoization**: Added caching in Get-ScopeDisplayName for AU names and scope strings to reduce repeat Graph calls.
